            <strong>Short details of my brother</strong>
            <p>God has blessed me with a lovely brother. He is 4 years younger than me. I love him very much. His name
                is Reduone. I call him Ridu. He is very naughty and very much attached to me.
                I still remembered that day when he was born. He was born very thin, small just like soft cotton. When
                he was born he hardly sleep and cries a lot. He never allows me and my parents to sleep. I was never
                attached to him when we have a little baby because he always used to cry for no reason. But our
                brotherhood started taking place when he started growing.

                When he started growing up to 4 months old he started recognizing me as his family member. I gradually
                started playing with him and taking care of him. I starting loving the way he used to touch me. Mom was
                very happy to see us playing together. When he became a little older we started playing together. Then
                he started understanding the things and started snatching away all my toys from me. I used to get
                ignited the way he used to do.
