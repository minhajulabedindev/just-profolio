            <strong>Short details of my brother</strong>
            <p>God has blessed me with a lovely brother. He is 4 years younger than me. I love him very much. His name
                is Reduone. I call him Ridu. He is very naughty and very much attached to me.
                I still remembered that day when he was born. He was born very thin, small just like soft cotton. When
                he was born he hardly sleep and cries a lot. He never allows me and my parents to sleep. I was never
                attached to him when we have a little baby because he always used to cry for no reason. But our
                brotherhood started taking place when he started growing.

                When he started growing up to 4 months old he started recognizing me as his family member. I gradually
                started playing with him and taking care of him. I starting loving the way he used to touch me. Mom was
                very happy to see us playing together. When he became a little older we started playing together. Then
                he started understanding the things and started snatching away all my toys from me. I used to get
                ignited the way he used to do.

                love fighting with him now because I have realized that’s the essence of our relationship. No matter how
                much we fight over things but deep down we both love each other deeply. We bully each other and pull
                each other’s leg but we cannot live without each other. We share the same school and have common
                friends. Going to school together is a real fun.
